📉The process📈:
This project was really fun. It was my first project in Hyper Island. The idea was to create something that was a little crazy, just like the internet and websites were in the 90s. I wanted to create something with several landing pages instead of just one website so I created a "re-make" on fifa 1998 and mainly there were 4 different landing pages where you can choose games in a gallery, loading page, start page and game menu.

It was fun and educational
